abstract: >
  With the GIN-Tonic tool, we want to provide researchers with a default file organization and file sharing system for research projects, in order to facilitate research collaboration and lab management.
  In contrast to software developers, researchers mostly don’t organize their files according to some common standard.
  While data managers propose to design and follow such an organization, they fail at providing clear recommendations or examples to researchers; and there is no time specifically assigned to this task in the researcher’s work.
  We believe that providing researchers with a commonly accepted folder tree structure template could make a huge difference in promoting data management and facilitating research collaboration.
  In this blog, we present the results of an initial survey run in three neuroscientific collaborative research centers in Germany (CRC1315, CRC1158, CRC135), including a presentation of a new folder structure and its technical implementation in the GIN-Tonic application.
  Researchers from all research domains and country of origins are now invited to review this draft in a second survey.
