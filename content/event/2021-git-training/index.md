abstract: |
  Publishing experimental design and analysis code is a crucial step towards Open Science,
  because it improves reproducibility of research results.
  But what does it mean to develop open source software?
  Essentially, it's all about collaboration and version control.
  It means that from the first line on you're writing code or text to be read and edited by others,
  be it your colleagues, an interested stranger, or future-yourself.

  - It should be easy for somebody else to pick up your project at the current state and continue development.
  - State transitions in the project should be easy to comprehend
  - It should be easy to revert unwanted changes and return to an earlier state
  - It should be easy to try out ideas without having to delete your current state
  - It should be easy to reintegrate parallel work

  Git has been designed to meet these requirements and became the defacto standard versioning and collaboration tool in the OSS industry.
  After taking this course, participant will know the critical parts of git and how it can bring its strengths to research projects.
  The course can also be interesting for IT or RDM staff, because git doesn't make many assumptions about the projects it is used for.

## Agenda

During the course, I'll demonstrate Git usage.
If you want to reproduce my examples, you should have a computer running Git at hand.
Please see [this setup guide]({{<ref "../../post/2021-12-02-git-setup-guide">}}) for instructions.
