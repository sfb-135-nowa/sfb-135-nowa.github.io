**NOWA** (Neuroscientific Workflow Assistance) is the [infrastructure project][sfb135-inf] of the CRC 135.
It has been initiated to simplify research data management and data sharing across CRC projects, and thus enable easier cross-project research.
This can be approached by harmonizing data workflows and making data more interoperable.
NOWA provides different services, trainings, and a toolset to support this process, and especially the CRC members and their working groups are invited to join them.
