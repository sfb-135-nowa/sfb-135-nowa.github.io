Git with its command line usage is rooted in the open source movement and is free for everybody.
There are also a few different graphical git programs, and the more powerful ones are commercial.
Often users have to pay for commercial use, but non-profit organizations, open source initiatives, or user coming from a purely educational context are allowed to use the programs free of charge.
This pattern is typical for productive software in the area of software development.
If the product will be public domain, it mostly gets a discount.
As a member of an academic research group, you have a high chance to qualify for these discounts, because you produce research results that should be open or at least belong to common goods.

The software companies differ a bit in their pricing models and strategies.
Some of them have an official application procedure for our use-case; others don't, but applicants can send an informal request via email.
In this article I describe my findings about various git programs and their licensing procedures.

## Gitkraken

Gitkraken puts a strong emphasis on collaboration, teams, enterprises, less on individual users.
There is a free edition, but it doesn't support self-hosted platforms like our NOWA Gitlab or private repos on any platform.
It can be used locally, but you have to pull and push via command line.
Their Pro Edition is not subject to these restrictions.
The company doesn't offer a discount itself, but teachers and researchers (academic staff) can get a free Gitkraken Pro license through Github's [Teacher Toolbox].
In order to apply, these steps are needed:

1. [Join Github] with your university email. If you already have a Github account, [add and verify][email-settings] your university email.
2. [Get the toolbox]. In addition to a valid school email, you have to upload an employment prove.
3. Connect your github account with Gitkraken and enjoy the Pro features.
