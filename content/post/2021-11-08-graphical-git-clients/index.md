Git with its command line usage is rooted in the open source movement and is free for everybody.
There are also a few different graphical git programs, and the more powerful ones are commercial.
Often users have to pay for commercial use, but non-profit organizations, open source initiatives, or user coming from a purely educational context are allowed to use the programs free of charge.
This pattern is typical for productive software in the area of software development.
If the product will be public domain, it mostly gets a discount.
As a member of an academic research group, you have a high chance to qualify for these discounts, because you produce research results that should be open or at least belong to common goods.

The software companies differ a bit in their pricing models and strategies.
Some of them have an official application procedure for our use-case; others don't, but applicants can send an informal request via email.
In the following sections, I describe my findings about various git programs and their licensing procedures.
