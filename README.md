# SFB 135 NOWA Support page

This repo is the source from which the [support page] of the CRC 135's [Inf project] is generated.
The site is statically built with [Hugo] and published via Github Pages.
So the website is not updated with a CMS, but by editing the files in this repo.

## Contributions

Feedback, questions, or suggestions are appreciated and can be reported in two ways:

- Either contact the [NOWA team]
- Or if you want to contribute actively or have discovered technical issues with the site, create an issue/PR in this repo
